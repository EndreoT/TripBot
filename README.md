# Trip Bot

### Description
TripBot is an interactive web application that lets users find restaurants, hotels, and activities for a chosen destination.

### How It Works
* Users sign in using Firebase's authentication by way of the Google provider for a personalized experience.
* Once signed in, users are prompted to answer a couple of questions to help TripBot customize their trip planning experience. 
* After submition of the questionnaire the app utilizes an AJAX call to the FourSquare API to provide users with card suggestions for restaurants, hotels, and activities in their selected location. 
* Users can dynamically select the venues of their choice and move them to their dashboard section. 
* Once in their dashboard section these hotel and restaurant suggestions can be saved as their itinerary. 

### Results
* Personal achievements include developing Firebase authentication, storage of user information, location information cards, and chat messages. Also dynamically created location cards.
* Collaborated in a team of four
* Four Square API yielded limited results and a quota on image requests

### Future improvements
* Allow multiple cities to be chosen
* Implement draggable location cards
* Allow users to form private groups for group itinerary planning
